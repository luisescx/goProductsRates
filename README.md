<h6>This is a student project built with Go language, which demonstrates a basic implementation of RabbitMQ, Grafana, Prometheus, SQLite, and Unit Testing.
</h6>

## Project Overview

<h6>The project uses RabbitMQ to demonstrate a basic message queue architecture, which allows for decoupling of different services in a system. Grafana is used to visualize the metrics provided by Prometheus, which is used for monitoring the performance and health of the system. SQLite is used as a lightweight database for storing data in the project.

The project also includes unit testing, which ensures the functionality and reliability of the code.
